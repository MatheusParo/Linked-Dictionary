# Linked Dictionaries

## Objective
- [x] Create a program that takes in a file of words and sort them through Linked Lists.
- [x] Create a new file with the sorted list.
- [x] Take in arguments and return the words corresponding to argument.
- [x] Make it clean and faster.
- [ ] Get a good grade from the project.

### Structure 
This is supposed to be done as soon as you read the word, it is identified where to be stored and put into the dict automatically.
We approached it with coming up with a linked list of linked lists with different letters of the alphabet so that it would faster the program, since it would only compare with words of the same first letter.
Therefore we create the linked lists:

```java
    static String alphabet="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz√©";
    static LinkedList<LinkedList> dict = new LinkedList<>();
    [...]
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        for ( char letter : alphabet.toCharArray()){
            dict.add(new LinkedList<String>());
        }
    [...]
```
Now we have 27 different linked lists for each starter letter in the alphabet.

### File reader
In order to read the file we need to create an object File with the path of the file and a Scanner with the file as argument, after this using *scan.nextLine()* will return the word on the specific line.
```java
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(file);
            while (sc.hasNextLine()) {
                String i = sc.nextLine().toLowerCase();
                
                int indicator = alphabet.indexOf(i.charAt(0));
                int position = getPosition(i, indicator);
                if(position != -1) {
                
                    dict.get(indicator).add(position, i);
                    
                }
                else {
                
                    dict.get(indicator).add(i);
                    
                }
            }
            sc.close();
```
### Sorting 
Since we could *not* use the sorting algorithm for the array we came up with our own known as *getPosition()*, this goes through the word and checks the first letter. After knowing the letter we need to send it to the correct linked list through our int Indicator, which is in int value the representation of which letter it starts. After that we check within the linked list and compare to all words that are smaller than the real word. If thelist is empty it will return -1 and be added randomly.
```java
public static int getPosition(String word, int indicator) {
        String temp = Character.toString(word.charAt(0));
        int index = dict.get(indicator).indexOf(temp);

        if (index < 0){
            index = 0;}

        for(int j = index; j < dict.get(indicator).size(); j++) {
            String word_2 = (String) dict.get(indicator).get(j);
            if (word.compareTo(word_2) < 0){
                return j;
            }

        }
        return -1;
    }
```
